During the execution of the pipeline this directory should be populated with the following files:
20mers_minocc_X.txt
20mers_minoccX_merged.txt
20mers_minoccX_pos.bed
20mers_minoccX_pos.txt
filtered_blast.txt
filteredblast_all_strains.txt
repeated_sequences_X.fasta
repeated_sequences_X.txt
repeated_sequencesfinal_X.txt
unfiltered_blast.txt
unfilteredblast_all_strains.txt

where X denotes the minimum copy number cut-off for 20mers used,
and repeated_sequencesfinal_X.txt contains the multi-copy sequences.
